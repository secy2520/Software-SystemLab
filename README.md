# Mini-Project
## Title: Design and Development of Course Registration Portal (Academia).
### Description: The project aims to develop a Academia Portal that is user-friendly and multifunctional.
The project should have the following functionalities:
1. All Student and Faculty details and Course information are stored in files.
2. Account holders have to pass through a login system to enter their accounts, and
all these User accounts will be managed by the Administrator.
3. Roles to implement: Faculty, Student, Admin.
4. The application should possess password-protected administrative access, thus
preventing the whole management system from unauthorized access.
5. Once the Admin connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:
Do you want to:
- Add Student
- Add Faculty
- Activate/Deactivate Student
- Update Student/Faculty details
- Exit
6. Once the Student connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:
Do you want to:
- Enroll to new Courses
- Unenroll from already enrolled Courses
- View enrolled Courses
- Password Change
- Exit
7. Once the Faculty connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
After successful login, He/She should get menu for example:
Do you want to:
- Add new Course
- Remove offered Course
- View enrollments in Courses
- Password Change
- Exit
